    "# System and Process Automation with Python\n",

    "### Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "For cost control, every day your boss asks for a report with all the company's purchases of goods.\n",
    "Your job, as an analyst, is to send him an e-mail, as soon as you start work, with the total spent, the quantity of products bought, and the average price of the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations: This project was idealized by Hashtag training sessions in order to introduce python possibilities for beginners with applications for the real world. In this challenge I was able to regain my taste for automation and also add to the project with some tools that I felt were necessary such as formatting number in the brazilian currency using locale module and being able to find the most recent file in the folder with os and glob modules. Time sleep was extensively used in order to wait my computer to execute commands before moving to the next ones. Next step is to replace those repeated lines of code with commands that consider these delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions are welcome! Thanks for the attention in this simple project :)"
